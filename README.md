# FantasyAnalyzer
A python program for analyzing fantasy football data and projecting the best fantasy draft picks.

To Do/Road map
- Need to add graphical plotting methods/visualization of data using the matplot lib library
- Need to add age data along with potential ways to analyze age
    - Add a way to find out the amount of years in the league for each individual player then add that to the general data table
    - Use the pro football rankings weights/previous calculations in order to assign a weighted age grade to the player to better generate the total weight score for the player
- Need to add a method of calculating a weighted score based on a multitude of inputs (avg mean rank + avg sum rank + etc.)
- Add better documentation for the current features within the application

Done/Check List
